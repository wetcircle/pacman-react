Sprite tiles are 8x8 pixels - this is just how the sprite are setup.

Screen tiles are 8*8 * 2.5 = 20x20 pixels.

The maze has 28x31 tiles.

Screen tiles are given in screen coordinates, which translate directly to the screen.

Conversion from tile coordinates to screen coordinates is based on the center of the screen tile.
Therefore Tile 0/0 is at 10/10 and Tile 1/1 is at 30/30.

Because the artifact tiles have to be displayed on the screen, they are zoomed by factor 2.5 in order fit.



What if I have the following game-level conditions?
  - Starting round
  - Ghosts scatter
  - Ghosts chasing
  - Pacman energized
  - Pacman dead
  - Game Over

Then the ghosts no longer have a scatter/chasing mode.
And pacman no more chasing mode.
Ghosts have:
  - (later) waiting in house
  - (later) leaving house
  - normal
  - dead

pacman hat:
  - normal
  - dead

What happens when a ghost has reached his house after death?
He stays in the house and only comes out after the end of the Pacman energized phase.
I.e. I can easily have these states at the game level.
Ghost gets a new state "Waiting in house" and "Leaving house".
